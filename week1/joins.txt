Equi Join:

select  eid,ename,salary , d.dno , dname ,location  from employee e , dept  d  where e.dno = d.dno;

Non-Equi Join: 

select  eid,ename,salary , d.dno , dname ,location  from employee e , dept  d  where e.dno != d.dno;

Cross Join: 

select  eid,ename,salary , d.dno , dname ,location  from employee e   CROSS JOIN   dept  d  
 where e.dno = d.dno;

Natural Join:
mysql> select  eid,ename,salary , dno , dname , location from employee NATURAL JOIN Dept;




Outer Join:
It is used to join tables  to fetch matching records along with non-matching.

Note: Outer joins used ON clause ,  because where clause not allowed

Left outer Join:
select eid,ename,job , d.dno , dname from  employee e  left outer join dept  d on e.dno = d.dno;

Right outer join:
 select   d.dno , dname ,location , eid, ename, job from  employee e   right outer join  dept d ON e.dno = d.dno;


Full Outer Join:

 select eid,ename,job , d.dno , dname from  employee e  left outer join dept  d ON e.dno = d.dno
 -> UNION
 -> select eid,ename,job , d.dno , dname from  employee e  right outer join dept  d ON e.dno = d.dno;


SELF Join:
-----------
When we join table by itself.

mysql> Select E.eid,E.ename ,M.eid , M.ename   from employee E , employee M   where E.mid = M.eid;

 Select E.eid,E.ename ,M.eid , M.ename , M.mid   from employee E , employee M   where E.mid = M.eid;
